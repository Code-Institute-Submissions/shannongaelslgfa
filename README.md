## Shannon Gaels LGFA


I decided to create a site for the Shannon Gaels Ladies Gaelic Football Club based on the fact that they currently don’t have a website and being involved in coaching one of the underage teams, I thought it would be a great opportunity to provide more information and hopefully inspire new members to join. In the future I hope to add more features to the site that will benefit both the club and members.

#### Structure:
The main aim of this site is to provide details, pictures and links relating to the Shannon Gaels Ladies Gaelic 
Football Club. The site content will be both factual, inspirational and practical for all users. 
This is achieved by providing club history, aspirational pictures of club matches and players. 
Finally, having links to club location and key resources.


With this in mind a single-page layout with easy flow from section to section is best suited to the 
users that will be accessing the site. There will be a navigation menu contained in a fixed top 
header, which means that the user will be easily able to move around the site as needed. 
This will fulfil the user story -

The home page contains a high-quality image with the club name. This is then followed on by the 
About section of the site, which gives details on the club and some history. This will fulfil the user story -

It is envisioned that people accessing the site will range from young players, 
parents and interested parties in the community. With this is mind and the fact that 
most access will be by mobile devices; the design will be focused primarily for this 
format. The site will be responsive and the layouts will change dependant on screen size. 
This will ensure that the content of the site will remain appealing and readable on all 
devices. This will fulfil the user story - 
> I want to be able to access the site from all device types.


#### Design:

Colour scheme: 

After consulting with some of the club officials, I decided that the use of the club colours of #d6be0e yellow and #6cba1f green would be the best to emphasise the club brand. The background colour is set as white with the yellow and green being incorporated into Navigation Bar, Footer, Section divider. I had originally thought of using the yellow and green for the background colour, but after trialling found it to be too overpowering and distracted from the content of the site.

Typography:

The main font used throughout the site is Open Sans, which is the official font used by the club. Sans Serif is used as a fallback font.

Imagery:
 
The club has provided me with their Logo, which will be used in the Navbar. Other images of the club sign, grounds, and flags were taken by me and will be used throughout the site, so that users can easily identify with the club.
